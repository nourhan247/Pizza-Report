# Pizza-Report

## Project Overview

In this project, I used SQL and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize data. The goal was to simulate a real-world scenario: from data ingestion and preprocessing, to analysis and building an interactive dashboard that stakeholders can use for decision-making.

I completed this as part of the **NTI Summer Training**, to consolidate my knowledge and demonstrate my ability to handle data projects end to end.

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** — for querying, cleaning, and aggregating raw data  
- **Power BI Desktop** — for building reports and dashboards  
- **DAX** (Data Analysis Expressions) — for calculated measures, custom metrics  
- **Data cleaning tools/steps** — e.g. handling missing values, fixing data types, removing duplicates

## Steps / Workflow

Below is the step-by-step process I followed:

1. **Data Loading & Inspection**  
     • Import the dataset
     • Check for missing values, data types, outliers  

2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
     • Handle missing or inconsistent values  
     • Normalize / standardize where needed  
     • Create necessary derived fields (dates, categorizations)  

3. **SQL Querying & Aggregation**  
     • Use SQL to compute summary statistics (aggregates, counts, averages, etc.)  
     • Filter by relevant criteria  

4. **Power BI Modeling**  
     • Import cleaned / aggregated data   
     • Create calculated columns / measures using DAX  

5. **Visualization & Dashboard Creation**  
     • Design visuals: (bar charts, Area chart, Donut charts,slicers/filters)  
     • Ensure usability: interactive filters, tooltips, clear labels  

6. **Analysis & Insights**  
     • Identify trends, anomalies, patterns  
     • Answer specific questions (e.g. Which category is performing best? , Which pizza name is the best or worst seller?)
